"# admin-ui" 
This is a admin UI. In this project, I have completed below mentioned points.

1. I have used REST Api to fetch data and inject that data into DOM, also considering search params.
2. I have used memory such as array to store the updated data of members.
3. I have used bootstrap for UI.
4. There are some conditional rendering based on user input such as query in search bar parameter.
5. I have used pagination.js cdn for pagination at the bottom of page.
6. The pagination works according to the available row after search or without search.
